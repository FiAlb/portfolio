# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! 

This repository contains four projects focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning techniques. Each folder represents a unique project that showcases different skills and tools for working with data.

### Project_1: Function Definitions for Data Exploration

   This project "Disney+ Movies and TV Shows" contains a set of function definitions focused on data exploring tasks.  
   
   Skills: Python functions and data exploring.

### Project_2: Function Definitions & Data Visualization

   This project focuses on an EDA process on data from a muesli company. In addition to function definitions for data cleaning, this project includes data visualizations to better understand the dataset.
   
   Skills: Data visualization with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, EDA, function definitions for cleaning.

### Project_3: Hypothesis Testing & Visualization

   This project "Trending YouTube Videos" goes deeper into EDA with hypothesis testing and various data visualizations.
   
   Skills: Hypothesis testing, visualization, identifying patterns, and interpreting insights.

### Project_4: Visualization of Geo-Data

   This project "Bike Theft in Berlin" is dedicated to visualizing geographical data, highlighting spatial patterns and trends after a EDA process.
   
   Skills: Geographical data visualization, working with libraries such as GeoPandas.

Moreover, the python notebooks "Conditions", "Dictionaries_and_Loops", and "Lists" show examples of the respective data structures.
